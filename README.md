# LexTree: A minimal tree-walk interpreter for Lex language

> Thinking to make this readme like an article as I implement this but let's see where it goes :)

- The `demo/` folder is just for the implementation testing purpose and trying out new things, it has nothing to be presented so ignore

- [Lexer](LexTree/Lexer)
- [Parser](LexTree/Parser)
- [Interpreter](LexTree/Interpreter)
